## Tech Stack

This site is written in vanilla JavaScript (+ TypeScript for type checking) and a little bit of ReactJS for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling; and Markdown is used for blog contents. It is based on the Astro Paper template by Satnaing [repo](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).
